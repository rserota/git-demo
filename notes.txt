What is a Git repository?
A branching, historical timeline, with commits, and connections between those commits, and labels for each commit.

Ways to refer to commits:

HEAD: currently checked out commit
Commit ID: uniquely identifies a commit. Never changes.
Branch name: e.g., 'Master'
HEAD^^: 2 commits before HEAD
HEAD~2: 2 commits before HEAD

Diagnostic commands:
git status: shows us add/committed files, what branch we're on, other info
git log: shows info about the current commit, and all parents of that commit
